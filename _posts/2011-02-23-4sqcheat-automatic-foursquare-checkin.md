This is a quick script I wrote some time ago to _steal_ the mayorship from a friend on a concrete [foursqure](http://foursquare.com/) venue. You can launch it from cron to steal a mayorship or launch it manually get any impossible badge :)

Usage example: `./4sqcheat.sh venue_id`

Get the _venue\_id_ from the foursquare venue URL, for example, if you want to check in at [Barcelona Airport](http://foursquare.com/venue/1136309), the venue URL is "foursquare.com/venue/ **1136309**", the number is the _venue\_id_ you have to pass to the script.
