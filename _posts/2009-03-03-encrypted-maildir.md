I've been thinking on encrypting user's Maildir on a new mail server, however I can't find a good solution for that.

Anybody has come with a solution to encrypt user's Maildir which is not vulnerable to plaintext attacks by sending an email knowing where it will end up to the encrypted mounted fileystem?
