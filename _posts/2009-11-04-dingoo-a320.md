Yesterday I got a [Dingoo A320](http://www.dingoo888.cn/) as a birthday present :D (thanks iolanda!!!). Here are my notes of things i need to remember in the future...

To upgrade the firmware (I flashed [official 1.20](http://dingoo-scene.blogspot.com/2009/11/firmware-120-seen-in-wild-fixes-yb.html)) just copy the firmware file (named a320.hxf) to the root folder of the dingoo internal memory, disconnect it from your computer and switch it off, then press and hold "down" and switch on your dingoo again. After the firwmare has been updated the a320.hfx file can be deleted from the dingoo.

To check the LCD type (to choose the correct kernel and dual-boot bootloader for [Dingux](http://www.dingux.com)) just go to system setup - about, and press up-right-down, up-right-down. My LCD module is ILI9331.
