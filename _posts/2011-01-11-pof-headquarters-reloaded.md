This is just a quick post to inform of the recent changes I've done with the server during the Christmas holidays:

- Switched from [OVH <acronym title="Real Private Server">RPS</acronym>](http://www.ovh.es) to [Linode <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>](http://www.linode.com).
- Moved the physical location of the server from France, to United Kingdom (without any noticeable downtime, yay!).
- Updated the [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) theme, although the look & feel is quite similar to the previous one, this has been written as a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) of the popular "[twentyten](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentyten)" theme, so it now supports widgets and all the fancy wordpress features.
- Changed the base distribution from [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org) to [Ubuntu Server](http://www.ubuntu.com/server)
- Changed the mail server from [Qmail](http://www.qmail.org) to [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org).
- Setup a new [microblog](/microblog/), which is basically an automatic backup of my [twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/pof), so I can do searches and avoid loosing old tweets when I reach the API limit.
- Registered a 3 letter domain and created [x90.es](http://x90.es), a public URL shortening service, which runs on this server too :) feel free to use it!
