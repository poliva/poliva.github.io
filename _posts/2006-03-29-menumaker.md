Acabo de descubrir una utilitat interessant, [MenuMaker](http://menumaker.sourceforge.net/):

MenuMaker is utility written entirely in Python that scans through the system for installed programs and generates menu for specified X window manager. It is by far more superior to existing solutions in terms of knowledge base size, maintainability and extensibility, and has a number of features that have no counterparts in its class. MenuMaker is intended for users of lightweight \*NIX graphical desktop environments.

Els gestors de finestres suportats son els seg√ºents:

- BlackBox
- Deskmenu
- FluxBox
- IceWM
- OpenBox, version 3
- PekWM
- WindowMaker
- XFCE, version 4
